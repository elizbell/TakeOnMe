We see you in the distance as your weapon glistens
We hold our breath, we wait and listen
My end has come and I welcome glory
No one will know the truth to this story

The iron in my chest is not beating
It's burning - and smoking - and turning
I know what's coming... I asked it here
And with it the rain and thunder - electricity
Everything changes - tonight

Crashman paces back and forth
Inside walls reinforced
Gotta gotta get out of this town
Gotta take that Wily down
Crash bombs mounted to his arms
Locked... loaded... ready... armed
Gotta gotta get out of this town
Gotta bring that Wily down

Closer draws the final hour
To break Wily's walls you will need my power
But to your aid, an unlikely friend
Programmed to fight till the very end!

A fitting death
My hands are gone
Replaced by fire
And intent
Soiled in their conception

A whistle
An omen
The breath stops. Mine?
Time for battle?
Yes

Crashman paces back and forth
Inside walls reinforced
Gotta gotta get out of this town
Gotta take that Wily down
Crash bombs mounted to his arms
Locked... loaded... ready... armed
Gotta gotta get out of this town
Gotta bring that Wily down

And so they fought
The clash of metal and grinding gears echoed across the night sky
Victory was at hand
But in the end... his will overcame the program

Down falls Crashman...
